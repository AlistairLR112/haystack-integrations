fast**RAG** is a research framework designed to facilitate the building of retrieval augmented generative pipelines. Its main goal is to make retrieval augmented generation as efficient as possible through the use of state-of-the-art and efficient retrieval and generative models. The framework includes a variety of sparse and dense retrieval models, as well as different extractive and generative information processing models. fastRAG aims to provide researchers and developers with a comprehensive tool-set for exploring and advancing the field of retrieval augmented generation.

It includes custom nodes such as:
- Image Generators
- Knoweldge Graph Creator
- Document Shapers 

## üìç Installation

Preliminary requirements:

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch

In a new virtual environment, run:

```bash
pip install .
```

There are various dependencies, based on usage:

```bash
